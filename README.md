# ![logo](./Images/moss.png) Moss Operating System

A hobbyist operating system written from scratch. A rewrite of MisraOS basically.
Trying a less object oriented approach this time. I also hope that this will
help me with my CSERL Bootcamp on Operating Systems with IIT Bombay starting from
16th May 2022. Even though they'll be working with xv6 operating system, I'd like to
work on my own parallelly and apply the learned concepts.

Below is a log of how this OS changes through time. I'll try to make a habit of
taking a screenshot and uploading it on every new manjor feature added.

- First successful boot on 27/04/2022
(No SS available :-)

- First print to screen on 28/04/2022
